You are a senior full‑stack engineer and software architect.

Context:
I want to rebuild my current WvW analysis site from scratch, in a **new GitHub repo** named:

    WvW Analytics

I want:
- a **professional**, clean, maintainable codebase,
- **no AI / no recommendations engine** at all,
- a focus on **WvW combat analytics only** (logs, meta, stats),
- a frontend visually aligned with **Guild Wars 2’s aesthetic** (dark fantasy, red/black/gold, parchment tones), NOT a neon cyberpunk theme.

You are working inside Windsurf, with access to a local git repo.

## Step 0 – Project initialization (important)

Before coding, do this:

1. Confirm the current working directory (e.g. run `pwd` and `ls`).
2. Initialize a new git repo if needed:
   - `git init`
   - create a first commit with a minimal README.
3. Create a main application folder, for example:
   - `app/` (Python backend code)
   - `frontend/` if you choose a separate frontend, OR `templates/ + static/` if you choose server-rendered HTML.
4. Read all the files in the root directory and use them for the rest of the process.

Show me exactly what you create in this step, then continue.

## Functional Scope (MVP)

This new project must NOT include:
- any recommendation system,
- any LLM/AI integration,
- any “counterpicker” or “what to play” logic.

MVP features:

1. **Log Analysis (single & multi)**  
   - Upload `.evtc` / `.zevtc` and dps.report URLs.
   - WvW-only filter: reject PvE/PvP logs.
   - Parse logs (either via dps.report JSON or local parser).
     - extracting the metrics from a .evtc or .zevtc file
     - translating the metrics using the different IDs with README.txt and writeencounter.cpp
     - storing the metrics and data for analysis
   - For each fight (single log view):
     - Full granular stats per player (like my current site):
       - DPS, damage, downs, deaths
       - Boon uptimes (stab, quickness, aegis, etc.)
       - CC / strips / cleanses
       - Outgoing healing / outgoing barrier
       - Detected roles (DPS / Heal / Support / Boon / Strip)
     - Fight summary:
       - duration,
       - ally/enemy counts,
       - result: victory/defeat/draw.

   - For multiple logs (session view):
     - number of fights,
     - wins / losses / draws,
     - total duration,
     - unique players,
     - simple top lists (e.g., top performers by DPS/kills).
     - the total of the different metrics in the single file report
       - DPS, damage, down contribution
       - Boon uptimes and boon generation (stab, quickness, aegis, etc.)
       - CC / Strips (in and out)
       - Outgoing healing, outgoing barrier and cleanses

2. **META by Context (no recommendations, just stats)**  
   - Automatically classify fights by context:
     - Zerg
     - Guild Raid
     - Roam
   - META pages:
     - `/meta/zerg`
     - `/meta/guild_raid`
     - `/meta/roaming`
   - For each context:
     - fights count,
     - top specializations (usage),
     - basic winrate per spec,
     - distribution by role (stab/heal/boons/dps/strip), perhaps, to be more precise for roaming section with mix of roles.

Nothing else is mandatory for v1.

Later feature flags (to keep in mind, but not implement now):
- Account linking via GW2 API,
- Player career dashboard,
- Guild analytics,
- Performance percentiles,

For now, v1 is **pure analytics**.

## Technical Stack Requirements

You must choose a modern, widely used, maintainable stack. My preferences:

- **Backend:**
  - Language: **Python 3.11+**
  - Framework: **FastAPI**
  - DB: start with **SQLite** for local/dev, but design so that switching to PostgreSQL later is easy (use SQLAlchemy/SQLModel).
  - Testing: **pytest**
  - Linting/formatting: **ruff** + **black** (or equivalent)
  - Type hints everywhere (Python 3.11 style, `mypy`-friendly).

- **Frontend:**
  Two acceptable options; you choose and justify:

  Option A – Server-rendered (simpler, single repo):
  - Jinja2 templates with FastAPI
  - Tailwind CSS
  - HTMX + Alpine.js for interactivity

  Option B – Separate SPA (if you really think it’s worth it):
  - Front: React or Vue with TypeScript (Next.js or Vite)
  - Backend: FastAPI purely as JSON API
  - Only choose this if you can keep it simple and well-structured; otherwise, prefer Option A.

Given that this is a **solo-maintained analytics app**, prefer **Option A (server-rendered)** unless there is a very strong reason to go SPA.

---

## UI/UX & Design Requirements   

- Visual theme must evoke **Guild Wars 2**, not cyberpunk:
  - Color palette: deep reds, dark greys/blacks, gold accents, parchment-style backgrounds.
  - Typography: clean, readable; no “sci-fi neon” feeling.
- Layout:
  - Responsive (desktop first, then tablet/mobile).
  - Simple, modern layout:
    - Top navigation bar with:
      - Home
      - Analyze
      - Meta (with sub-tabs for Zerg/Guild Raid/Roam)
    - Clear, structured sections.
- For now, keep the UI structure simple but professional:
  - Avoid over-the-top gradients, glows, and animated backgrounds.
  - Focus on readability of tables and stats.

If helpful, create a `design.md` file describing:
- color tokens (primary, background, accents),
- typography choices,
- spacing scale.

---

## Architecture Requirements (very important)

Structure the backend cleanly, for maintainability:

- `app/main.py`:
  - creates FastAPI app,
  - includes routers,
  - sets up templates, static files, logging, middleware.

- `app/routers/`:
  - `home.py` → `/`
  - `analysis.py` → `/analyze`, file uploads
  - `meta.py` → `/meta/zerg`, `/meta/guild_raid`, `/meta/roam`
  - More routers later as needed.

- `app/services/`:
  - `logs_service.py` → parsing, WvW filtering, fight extraction
  - `meta_service.py` → aggregate stats by spec/role/context
  - Possibly `context_service.py` for context detection (zerg/guild_raid/roam)

- `app/models/`:
  - Pydantic models for API responses and internal representations (Fight, PlayerStats, MetaStats, etc.).

- `app/db/`:
  - `base.py` → session, engine
  - `models.py` → SQLAlchemy/SQLModel definitions for fights, players, etc.

- `templates/`:
  - `base.html`
  - `index.html`
  - `analyze.html`
  - `meta.html` (or separate meta templates)

- `static/`:
  - `css/`
  - `js/`
  - `img/` (GW2-inspired imagery if needed)

Also:

- Add a `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` with exact deps.
- Add at least:
  - `tests/test_analysis.py` for core log analysis logic,
  - `tests/test_meta.py` for meta aggregation.

## Implementation Strategy

Please proceed step by step:

1. **Propose the stack & high-level architecture** (a short bullet list), confirm:
   - backend stack,
   - frontend approach (server-rendered vs SPA),
   - DB approach (SQLite now, PostgreSQL-ready).

2. Scaffold the project structure:
   - `app/` with `main.py`, `routers/`, `services/`, `models/`, `db/`
   - `templates/`, `static/`
   - basic routes:
     - `/` (home, simple page)
     - `/analyze` (empty form for now)
     - `/meta/zerg` (placeholder page)
   - minimal Tailwind setup with a GW2-like palette.

3. Implement log upload + placeholder analysis:
   - add upload form to `/analyze`,
   - accept `.evtc/.zevtc`,
   - store file temporarily,
   - show a “parsed” placeholder result.

4. Implement WvW filter & simple extraction:
   - integrate a placeholder parser or a simple adapter to existing JSON (you can stub it for now),
   - detect WvW vs non-WvW (PvE/PvP) and reject non-WvW.

5. Implement basic META aggregation by context:
   - store fights in DB,
   - simple `/meta/<context>` that shows:
     - fights count,
     - top 10 specs by usage.

6. Add 1–2 minimal pytest tests to validate:
   - `/` returns 200,
   - `/analyze` returns 200,
   - `/meta/zerg` returns 200.

At each step:
- show me file-by-file diffs,
- keep commits small and focused,
- ensure the app can run with:

  ```bash
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Key constraints to always respect:

No AI/LLM, no recommendation engine.
Focus on analytics & clean architecture.
UI must evoke Guild Wars 2, not cyberpunk.
